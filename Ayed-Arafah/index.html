                <em>Horizon</em> is an installation that is part of a bigger art project, sea package created by Ayed Arafah in 2010. The project is a multimedia display  that includes video art, live installation, and still photography.
               <br><br>
                <em>Horizon</em> is a line of plastic bags filled with blue colored water that are hung at different heights yet carry the same level of water creating the illusion of a sea horizon. A product of an exploration of self and circumstance, Arafah examines his attachment to the sea that has been rendered absent from his culture as an unacceptable body and a far away possibility. This deprivation led Arafah to look for any remnants of the sea in his walled city. He went to pet stores to look at fish, he asked friends to send him seawater from all over the world, and he sat with elders who remember the sea as part of their robbed lives. In the midst of this search for his history, Arafah, a refugee himself, explores the sea and its horizon as presented in his histories and absence in his current reality. How can the sea have such a big presence in the cultural narrative yet be experienced with such impossibility and absence? Horizon attempts to tackle these questions by providing a visual of his divided country, the missing sea, and the reflection of the blue skies in its  waters. An ode to the sea, and a loud longing for freedom, Horizon is a window into the world through the lens of refugees and all peoples who have been severed from their homelands and their future horizons.

                    В олонхо разрешается противоречие порядка и хаоса, добра и зла, устанавливается равновесие, воспринимаемое как единое слияние небесного и земного, и вся структура олонхо, его сюжетное дополнение и образная система строятся вокруг этой дуалистической мировоззренческой идеи, ведущей идеей которой является постоянство динамического равновесия.</p>

                Ayed Arafah was born in Jerusalem in 1983 and currently lives in Deheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem. He holds a BA in Contemporary Visual Arts from the Academy of International Arts, Ramallah. His works vary between drawing, composition, installation, video and photography. The practice of art to him is a journey of productions based on experiments, in which he seeks to develop his visual skills and relay between subjects and ideas that may produce endless questions. He believes that art is a process of rephrasing the calcified concepts or vocabulary produced by human societies.Ayed participated in local group exhibitions in Ramallah, Bethlehem, and Jericho, and internationally in London, Oslo, Cairo and Beirut. He participated in art programs in Amsterdam, the Austrian city of Graz and he also spent art residences in Biella, Italy, and the Rockefeller Estate in New York. Afterwards, he created a mural for the late activist, Rachel Corre, who was killed in Gaza. The mural is permanently exhibited at the Palestine Museum in New Haven, CT.  His solo art exhibitions entitled “Your Place is a Secret” at Bab al-Deir Gallery and  “Thor” or "Bull" at the Walled Off Hotel Gallery were held in Bethlehem. The last exhibition he held was in the Lebanese capital of Beirut entitled “From Jerusalem to Beirut”. He currently lives and works in his own studio in the city of Bethlehem, Palestine.

                Bisan Abu Eisheh (1985) is an artist from Palestine, where he was born and raised in the city of Jerusalem. Abu Eisheh is using art as a tool to investigate history, society and politics. Working across media, such as video, installations and interventions, with a practice situated both within the gallery space and the public sphere, his work attempts to create a shared awareness for himself as well as his audience about several details lost within grand narratives. Researching through different resources, from conversation and oral testimonies to archives and collected objects he tries to challenge the aesthetics of his artworks in order to bring some facts under the eyes of his viewers. By doing so, his works often aspire to open a dialog and, perhaps, seek answers related to several topics such as national identity, mobility, migration and socio-political injustice.
                <br><br>
                For his PhD, Breathing Archives, Abu Eisheh investigates the post-Oslo-agreement reality in juxtaposition with visual Palestinian art practices as a form of producing and distributing ‘tacit’ Palestinian knowledge. The collapse of the Oslo-agreement resulted in an obscured and fragmented knowledge about Palestine and its people. Therefore, Abu Eisheh’s PhD project resorts to art when both history and politics marginalize us. Through an on-going moderation of collective discussions, documentation and analysis with Palestinian artists living and working in different geographies, the project aspires to collect those truths lost within mainstream political discourses. The resulted knowledge will be eventually employed in the creation of a series of visual and performative outputs as well as preserving it for public and/or artistic use.

                    В олонхо разрешается противоречие порядка и хаоса, добра и зла, устанавливается равновесие, воспринимаемое как единое слияние небесного и земного, и вся структура олонхо, его сюжетное дополнение и образная система строятся вокруг этой дуалистической мировоззренческой идеи, ведущей идеей которой является постоянство динамического равновесия.</p>
